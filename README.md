# Context Engineering for GitHub Copilot

A comprehensive collection of context engineering patterns, practices, and interactive examples designed to help you master the art of working with GitHub Copilot and other AI coding assistants.

## 🎯 What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is the practice of structuring and organizing information to help AI assistants understand your needs and provide better results. This repository provides a complete learning path from fundamentals to advanced techniques, with a focus on **prompt engineering first, then tools**.

### 📖 Comprehensive Workshop Materials

This repository now includes the complete **Learn-SK Prompt Engineering Workshop** materials:

- **🎯 9 comprehensive modules** covering prompt engineering from basics to advanced techniques
- **⏱️ 3+ hours** of detailed enterprise-focused content  
- **🔧 Hands-on examples** with Semantic Kernel and Microsoft AI tools
- **📊 Testing & evaluation** frameworks for prompt effectiveness

## 🚀 Quick Start

### View the Presentation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to view the Slidev presentation on context engineering.

### Explore Interactive Notebooks

Open the polyglot notebooks in VS Code with the Polyglot Notebooks extension:

1. `notebooks/01-prompt-engineering-basics.ipynb` - Core prompt engineering concepts
2. `notebooks/02-advanced-prompt-patterns.ipynb` - Advanced techniques and patterns

### Complete Workshop Exercises

Work through the progressive workshop exercises in the `workshops/` directory:

1. **Exercise 1**: Improving Vague Prompts (15 min)
2. **Exercise 2**: Context Through Comments (20 min)
3. **Exercise 3**: Test-Driven Context (25 min)
4. **Exercise 4**: Tools and Context Engineering (30 min)

See `workshops/README.md` for detailed instructions.
