# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Context Engineering materials in 5 minutes!

## 🚀 Choose Your Path

### Path 1: View the Presentation (5 minutes)
Perfect for getting an overview of concepts.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open browser to `http://localhost:3030` and navigate through the slides.

---

### Path 2: Interactive Learning (45-60 minutes)
Best for hands-on learners.

**Prerequisites:** 
- VS Code
- Polyglot Notebooks extension
- .NET SDK 8.0+

**Steps:**
1. Open VS Code in this directory
2. Navigate to `notebooks/`
3. Open `01-prompt-engineering-basics.ipynb`
4. Select `.NET Interactive` kernel
5. Run cells and complete exercises

For concise, slide-aligned technique examples with real GitHub Copilot SDK notebook runs, open any notebook in `notebooks/prompt-engineering/`. Those notebooks are Python notebooks, so use a Python 3 / `ipykernel` kernel instead of `.NET Interactive`, install `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`, and make sure the VS Code Python and Jupyter extensions are installed.

---

### Path 3: Workshop Mode (90-120 minutes)
Ideal for team learning or thorough practice.

**Steps:**
1. Review `workshops/README.md` for overview
2. Complete exercises in order:
   - `exercise-01-improving-prompts.md` (15 min)
   - `exercise-02-context-comments.md` (20 min)
   - `exercise-03-test-driven-context.md` (25 min)
   - `exercise-04-tools-and-context.md` (30 min)
3. Apply learnings to real code

---

### Path 4: Reference Mode (As needed)
Use templates and patterns in your daily work.

**Quick Access:**
- **Prompty Templates:** See `prompty/README.md`
- **Pattern Examples:** See notebooks
- **Workshop Exercises:** See workshops directory
