# Context & Prompt Engineering



> "Prompt Engineering asks what should a user write; Context Engineering asks what should a model read."

<!--
> "The quality of AI assistance is directly proportional to the quality of context provided."

You might have heard of "prompt engineering" - and yes, that's related. But there's an important distinction we're going to explore today.

**Prompt engineering** asks: "What should the *user* write to get a good result?" - with an understanding of how llms behave and reason.

**Context engineering** asks: "What should the *model* read to understand what the user actually wants?"

That might sound very similar, but it's a fundamental shift in perspective. And this shift changes everything about how we get the most value from tools like GitHub Copilot.

Think about it this way: You can craft the perfect prompt, but if the model doesn't have the right context - the right background information, code examples, architectural patterns, registered tools, overall business goals, etc. - you'll still get suboptimal results. Context is the invisible foundation that makes prompts actually work.

## What We're Covering Today

We'll break this down into three main areas:

1. **The Foundations** - We'll start with prompt engineering basics and patterns you can use immediately with any AI tool.
2. **Advanced Context Strategies** - Then, we'll take a look at how to apply these patterns to the entire context (with and without user guided prompt optimizations) - and, more specifically, how they apply to the GitHub Copilot ecosystem.
3. **Applied Context Engineering** - Finally, we will build our own local environment optimized for our own developer experience.
