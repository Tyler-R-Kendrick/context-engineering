---

## Code Generation and Optimization

---

### Completion and Translation

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Gemini, GPT, or Claude excel at code completion and code translation tasks. Prompts can be crafted to help automate the generation of snippets, entire functions, or even translate code from one programming language to another.

---

### Generating Code via Prompts

LLMs can generate code in any language, offering significant productivity boosts.

**Example prompt for code generation:**

> **Goal:** Write a Bash script that renames all files in a folder by prepending "draft".
>
> **Prompt:** Write a code snippet in Bash, which asks for a folder name. Then it takes the contents of the folder and renames all the files inside by prepending the name draft to the file name.

The LLM-generated solution might look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the folder name: "
read folder_name

if [ ! -d "$folder_name" ]; then
    echo "Folder does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

files=( "$folder_name"/* )

for file in "${files[@]}"; do
    new_file_name="draft_$(basename "$file")"
    mv "$file" "$new_file_name"
done

echo "Files renamed successfully."
```

**Tip:** Always review and test code generated by LLMs.

---

### Code Explanation and Translation

LLMs can explain code in plain language to speed up onboarding and collaboration, e.g.:

> **Prompt:** Explain to me the below Bash code: ...
>
> **Output:** The model breaks down the script line by line in natural language.

LLMs can translate code between languages. Example prompt:

> **Prompt:** Translate the below Bash code to a Python snippet.
>
> **Output:** The LLM produces an equivalent Python script, potentially adapting to conventions or idioms of the target language.

## Text and Language Tasks

Prompt engineering for text and language tasks involves crafting prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to perform tasks such as creative writing, summarization, translation, and dialogue generation. Below is an overview and best practices for each of these categories:

---

### Creative Writing
**Definition:** Using LLMs to generate original content, such as stories, poems, or product descriptions.

**Prompt Engineering Tips:**
- Use role prompting to assign a creative persona (e.g., "You are a poet," "You are a travel blogger").
- Include contextual details. For example: “Write a short story about a robot discovering art in a futuristic city.”
- Experiment with output configurations:
  - Higher temperature (e.g., 0.7–0.9) encourages creativity and diversity.
  - Adjust top-K and top-P for more varied outputs (e.g., top-K = 40, top-P = 0.95).
- Be explicit with instructions: “Write in a humorous tone” or “Include a plot twist at the end.”

**Example:**
> Act as a fantasy novelist. Write a short scene where a dragon negotiates peace with a village.

---

### Summarization and Translation

---

#### Summarization
**Definition:** Producing concise summaries of longer texts.

**Prompt Engineering Tips:**
- Specify summary type: “Summarize the following text in three bullet points.”
- State the output length or structure: “Provide a 1-paragraph summary.”
- Use lower temperature for consistent and factual output (e.g., 0.2–0.3).
- System prompt can clarify purpose: “System: You are a professional editor who summarizes technical documents.”

**Example:**
> Summarize the following article in one paragraph, focusing on key findings and implications.

---

### Translation
**Definition:** Converting text from one language to another.

**Prompt Engineering Tips:**
- Specify source and target languages: “Translate the following English text to French.”
- Clarify style/tone if needed: “Translate using formal business language.”
- Use low temperature for accuracy (e.g., 0.2).
- System prompt: “System: You are a certified translator.”

**Example:**
> Translate the following paragraph to Spanish. Maintain a friendly and informal tone.

The same output controls (temperature, top-K, top-P) can be applied for translation precision and style.

---

### Dialogue Generation
**Definition:** Creating realistic, engaging multi-turn conversations.

**Prompt Engineering Tips:**
- Use role prompting for persona adoption (“You are a customer service assistant”).
- Provide dialogue context, previous messages, and speaker roles to ensure continuity and relevance.
- Set instructions for output style: “Respond kindly and professionally.”
- Control temperature to balance creativity and coherence (0.2 for fact-based, 0.6+ for creative dialogue).

**Example:**
> Act as a tech support agent. A user reports their laptop won’t turn on. Generate a 3-turn dialogue to help resolve the issue.

For longer dialogues, consider limiting token length and ensuring prompts retain necessary context for multi-turn coherence.

---

### General Best Practices Across Tasks
- Be specific about output requirements, structure, or format.
- Design with simplicity: Clear, concise, and unambiguous prompts yield better results.
- Use instructions over constraints: Tell the model what to do rather than what not to do.
- Iterate and experiment: Adjust configurations (temperature, top-K, top-P) and rephrase prompts for the best results.
- Include examples (for few-shot prompting) when zero-shot performance is insufficient.

---

## Question Answering

---

### Open-ended and Specific Questions

Open-ended questions invite detailed responses, allowing the model to elaborate based on training knowledge or reasoning. Specific questions have clearer, narrower expectations, often factual or seeking precise answers.

**Prompting Techniques:**

- **Zero-shot prompting** (just provide the question):
  - Example: `What caused the fall of the Roman Empire?`
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting:**
  - Encourages step-by-step reasoning, promoting accuracy—especially valuable for tasks requiring logical or multi-step solutions.
  - Example:
    > Q: When I was 3 years old, my partner was 3 times my age. Now I am 20 years old. How old is my partner? Let's think step by step.
    > 
    > The model then outputs reasoning steps before the answer, improving reliability over just giving the final result.

**Tips:**
- For factual, deterministic answers, use a low temperature (e.g., 0) to reduce randomness.
- For more creative open-ended responses, increase temperature/top-p, but monitor for coherence.

---

### Multiple-Choice and Hypothetical Scenarios

Multiple-choice questions benefit from:
- Giving examples of the format (few-shot prompting) for the model to follow.
- Explicit instruction to "choose one" or "select the best answer".

Hypothetical scenarios are effectively handled by:
- Framing the context clearly (role/contextual prompting), e.g.,
  - `If you were a climate scientist, how would you approach reducing urban air pollution?`
- Encouraging explanation:
  - `Please explain your reasoning for your selected answer.`

**Techniques:**
- Use step-back prompting to have the model consider general principles before applying them to specifics.
- Self-consistency prompting: Generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most common answer if ambiguity exists.

---

### Opinion-based Queries

The model can provide perspectives, but it's important to clarify whether the answer should mimic an expert, a group, or a neutral party (role prompting).

**Example Schema:**
- `As a historian, what is your perspective on the impact of the printing press?`
- `List the pros and cons of remote work for software engineers.`

**Tips:**
- Set the role and style for more relevant or engaging answers (e.g., "as a policy analyst... in a formal tone").
- If multiple perspectives are desired, explicitly request them:
  - `Summarize both sides of this debate regarding renewable energy adoption.`

---

### Best Practices for Question Answering Prompts

- **Be explicit:** Clarify expectations in the prompt—structure, tone, desired length.
- **Ask for reasoning:** "Explain your answer" yields more robust, trustworthy results.
- **Use context and role:** Guides the model to answer from the desired perspective.
- **Few-shot examples:** Increase accuracy, especially for classification or structured answers.
- **Control randomness:** Adjust model parameters based on the creativity or determinism needed.
- **Test and iterate:** Small changes in phrasing or examples can have large effects—document your prompt attempts.

## Image Generation and Editing

---

### Multimodal Prompt Design

**Definition:**

Multimodal prompting refers to using a combination of input formats (e.g., text, images, audio) to guide a large language or generative model. For image generation/editing, this typically means using detailed text instructions—possibly combined with an input image—for more targeted outputs.

---

**Best Practices:**

- **Be explicit:** Clearly state what you want to generate or edit (subject, style, colors, composition, context).
- **Provide examples:** If possible, show examples of desired outputs, or include reference images.
- **Use clear, descriptive language:** Specify attributes like perspective, lighting, and emotional tone.
- **Leverage system/context/role prompting:** Frame your prompt to set the expectations, context, and "role" of the model (e.g., "You are an expert digital artist...").

---

**Template Example:**

- **Prompt:** Generate a photorealistic image of a red sports car parked under a palm tree at sunset, viewed from a low angle.
- **Context:** The image should evoke a feeling of luxury and relaxation and use vivid, warm colors.

If editing, use similar specificity:

- **Prompt:** Edit the provided image by replacing the sky with a clear, blue sky with a few white clouds, and enhance the brightness.
- **Role:** You are a photo retoucher enhancing images for a travel magazine.

*Note: Test and refine prompts iteratively for best results.*

---

### Photorealistic and Artistic Images

---

#### Photorealistic Image Prompting

- Use precise, unambiguous language: specify real-world details, camera/lens type, lighting, realism level.
- Mention artistic techniques if needed, e.g., "bokeh background," "soft natural light."

**Examples:**

- "Create a high-resolution, photorealistic image of a golden retriever puppy sitting in a field of sunflowers. The lighting should be natural morning sunlight."
- "Generate a realistic photograph of a bustling Tokyo street at night, with neon signs and people carrying umbrellas."

---

#### Artistic Image Prompting

- State the style or movement: "in the style of Van Gogh," "cubist," "watercolor."
- Describe mood, palette, or composition elements: "Use cool blue and green tones for a calm, melancholic atmosphere."

**Examples:**

- "Create an abstract digital painting of a city skyline at dawn using pastel colors and impressionist brush strokes."
- "Generate a stylized illustration of a fox in a forest, in the style of Japanese woodblock prints."

**Modifiers:**

Use artistic modifiers (realism, fantastical, minimalism, dystopian, etc.) to steer the output as desired.

---

### Abstract Images and Editing

---

#### Abstract Image Generation

- Focus on shapes, color palettes, textures, and conceptual ideas.
- Avoid specific objects unless required; use prompts like:
  - "Generate a colorful abstract composition with swirling shapes and a sense of movement, inspired by Kandinsky."
  - "Create an abstract image representing the concept of growth using gradients of green and blue."

---

#### Image Editing Prompts

- Be direct about the edit: "Remove the background," "Add a beam of light coming from the top left," or "Change the subject’s shirt to red."
- If the system allows referencing image regions, use spatial language or coordinates: "Blur the lower right corner slightly."
- Combine with purpose/context: "Enhance sharpness and boost saturation for use in a digital ad campaign."

---

### General Best Practices For All Image Prompts

- **Simplicity:** Use concise prompts; avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Variables:** Consider using placeholders if programmatically generating prompts.
- **Experimentation:** Try various configurations (temperature, randomness, etc.) for variation and creativity.
- **Documentation:** Track your best-performing prompts for future reference and continued optimization.
