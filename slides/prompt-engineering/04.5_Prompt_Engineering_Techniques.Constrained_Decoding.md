# Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Advanced Techniques

### Constrained Decoding

Imposes syntactic, semantic, or business-rules constraints on output (e.g., requiring a valid JSON schema, restricting vocabulary, etc.) Useful for compliance, safety, and ensuring model responses can be programmatically parsed and trusted. Effective prompts balance clear instructions (what to do) and explicit constraints (what not to do).

---

#### Grounding
Grounding refers to ensuring that model outputs are based on verifiable facts or external data, rather than just the model's internal knowledge. This is crucial for applications requiring high factual accuracy.

---

#### Logit Biasing

#### Structured Output
Design prompts to elicit responses in predefined, machine-readable formats (such as JSON, XML, tables). Vital for integration with downstream applications or automated data pipelines.
