# Prompt Engineering Techniques

## Basic Techniques

---

### Clear and Specific Instructions
Providing clear and specific instructions is foundational in prompt engineering. Ambiguous or generic prompts often lead to vague or incorrect outputs from language models. Instead, specify exactly what you expect:

- Use unambiguous language.
- Indicate the format, scope, and depth required.
- Provide context as needed to reduce misunderstandings.

**Example:**
Instead of "Explain climate change," prompt:

> Summarize the primary causes of climate change in three bullet points, each with a one-sentence explanation.

---

### Reference Text and Citations
Including reference text or source material enhances factual accuracy and reliability. Instructionally, it’s productive to:

- Append background documents or snippets to your prompt.
- Ask the model to cite specific passages from the text.
- Use citation styles (e.g., inline quotes, (Author, Year)).

**Tip:**
> Based on the information provided in the following text, answer the question and include a citation for your sources.

---

### Task Decomposition
For multi-step or complex tasks, break down the instruction into digestible sub-tasks. This aligns the model’s output to your workflow and reduces cognitive load.

- List the required steps explicitly.
- Sequence instructions using numbering or bullets.
- Confirm completion of each part before proceeding.

**Example:**
1. Pull data from the attached table.
2. Summarize key trends.
3. Suggest one actionable next step.

---

### Instruction Placement
The order of information within your prompt strongly influences the quality and relevance of responses.

- Place the main task or question at the beginning for focus.
- Use separate paragraphs or sections for reference material and instructions.
- If requesting citations or format specifications, state them immediately before or after your main instruction.

**Example Structure:**
- **Context/Background:**
  [Relevant content]
- **Task:**
  [Instruction statement]
- **Formatting:**
  [How you want the answer structured]

### Output Priming and Syntax
Priming with example outputs or specifying required syntax improves consistency and utility.

- Provide sample answers or templates.
- Specify output limitations (e.g., bullet points, tables, JSON).
- If using the response as system input, state explicit formatting requirements.

**Example Prompt for Priming:**
> List three types of renewable energy. Answer in the following format:

- Solar
- Wind
- Hydroelectric
