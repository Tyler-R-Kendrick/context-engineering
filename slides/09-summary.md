# Best Practices Summary

Key takeaways for effective context engineering

<v-clicks>

✅ **Be Specific**: Clarity beats brevity
✅ **Provide Examples**: Show patterns you want
✅ **Define Constraints**: Set clear boundaries
✅ **Use Types**: Let the type system help
✅ **Write Tests First**: Define behavior upfront
✅ **Iterate**: Refine context based on results
✅ **Document**: Keep context accessible
✅ **Break Down**: Smaller tasks, better results

# Common Anti-Patterns

What NOT to do

<v-clicks>

❌ Too vague: "Make it better"
❌ Too complex: Trying to do everything at once
❌ No context: Expecting Copilot to read your mind
❌ Wrong scope: Asking for entire applications
❌ Ignoring results: Not iterating based on output
❌ No validation: Accepting suggestions blindly

# Key Takeaways

<v-clicks>

### Context Engineering Is Essential
- **Default context is insufficient** for complex tasks
- **Strategic engineering** multiplies effectiveness
- **Small context improvements** yield large quality gains

### Core Challenges Solved
- ✅ Limited attention through prioritization
- ✅ Context rot through refresh cycles
- ✅ Content poisoning through validation
- ✅ Forgetfulness through repetition
- ✅ Variance through standardization

### Practical Implementation
- Use Copilot's native tools (#file, #codebase, Spaces)
- Implement MCP servers for dynamic context
- Create spec.md and agents.md for structure
- Monitor metrics and adjust continuously
