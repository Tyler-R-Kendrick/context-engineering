# Workshop Exercises

This directory contains hands-on exercises to practice context engineering techniques with GitHub Copilot.

## Overview

These workshops are designed as a progressive learning path, focusing first on prompt engineering fundamentals, then advancing to tools and patterns.

## Exercises

### 1. Improving Vague Prompts (15 minutes)
**File:** `exercise-01-improving-prompts.md`

Learn to transform vague prompts into specific, actionable ones.

**Topics:**
- Specificity and clarity
- Input/output specifications
- Constraints and requirements
- Edge case handling

**Skills:** Prompt writing, requirement analysis

---

### 2. Context Through Comments (20 minutes)
**File:** `exercise-02-context-comments.md`

Master using comments to provide context for code generation.

**Topics:**
- Strategic comment placement
- Requirement documentation
- Error handling specifications
- Performance constraints

**Skills:** Documentation, context provision

---

### 3. Test-Driven Context (25 minutes)
**File:** `exercise-03-test-driven-context.md`

Use tests as specifications to drive implementation.

**Topics:**
- Writing tests first
- Defining behavior through tests
- Edge case discovery
- Test-driven development

**Skills:** Testing, specification, TDD

---

### 4. Tools and Context Engineering (30 minutes)
**File:** `exercise-04-tools-and-context.md`

Explore various tools and techniques for enhancing context.

**Topics:**
- Type systems as context

## Tips for Success

✅ **Do:**
- Take time to reflect on each exercise
- Experiment with variations
- Compare different approaches
- Share learnings with others
- Apply immediately to real work
- Iterate and refine techniques

❌ **Don't:**
- Rush through exercises
- Skip the reflection questions
- Work in isolation (if possible)
- Forget to apply learnings
- Give up if first attempt isn't perfect
