# Workshop Overview

This workshop equips teams to engineer reliable context for GitHub Copilot by layering documentation, prompt patterns, and tooling configuration across a repository. Participants work inside their own projects so every improvement immediately benefits day-to-day development.

## Purpose
- Establish durable instructions that align AI assistants with team standards.
- Capture reusable prompt workflows that reduce re-teaching and drift.
- Connect Copilot to trusted specifications and tooling for grounded responses.
- Centralize institutional knowledge so future requests start with shared context.

## What You Will Build
Across six guided activities you will:
- Draft an `AGENTS.md` playbook with [Create Agent Instructions](01_Create_Agent_Instructions.md).
- Turn repeatable requests into slash commands with [Create Custom Prompts](02_Create_Custom_Prompts.md).
- (Optional) Encode specialist expertise using [Create Custom Agents](03_Create_Custom_Agents.md).
- Wire trusted tools into Copilot through [Install and Configure MCP Servers](04_Install_MCP_Servers.md).
- Drive implementation from specifications via [Install and Configure Spec-Kit](05_Setup_Spec_Kit.md).
- Curate a shared knowledge hub in [Set Up Copilot Spaces](06_Setup_Copilot_Spaces.md).

## Format and Timing
Plan for 90–120 minutes total. Each activity typically takes 15–25 minutes, including time for teams to apply the step in their own repository and share takeaways. Close with a retrospective that highlights coverage gaps, automation opportunities, and next iterations.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub repository you can modify during the workshop.
- GitHub Copilot with access to Custom Prompts, Custom Agents (preview), and MCP support.
- Ability to run project build and test commands locally.
- Familiarity with your team’s coding standards, review practices, and security expectations.

## Outcomes
By the end of the workshop your team will have:
- A maintained instruction manual for AI collaborators.
- Versioned prompt templates and agent definitions stored alongside code.
- Configured MCP servers and Spec-Kit artifacts ready for daily use.
- A Copilot Space that anchors new work in shared, up-to-date context.

Use this document to set expectations, collect feedback, and revisit the workflow as your processes evolve.
